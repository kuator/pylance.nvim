# pylance.nvim

- https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/303
- https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/4

Works only on Unix-like systems like Linux and Mac. You have to have Visual Studio Code and the Pylance extension installed. The latest working version is: 2021.3.2

Pylance support for nvim-lsp. Don't star it, Microsoft will probably notice and the repo will have to be deleted.

This plugin contains a basic configuation for nvim_lsp and
[script](./install.sh) to download and install latest vscode pylance server.

Make sure jq, curl, unzip, vi are installed to make script work.
